#     dirpath : str
#         Path containing FASTA files to be read.
#     name : str
#         Name of alignment set
#     marker_kw : str or None, optional
#         Classifies the sample as a marker if the string is

#         Used to determine whether a file is a FASTA file (default is '.aln')

#         found in the sample's ID. (default is None)
#     filename_to_key_encoder : function or None, optional

#         object.
